### About Me

I am a fifth-year PhD student in linguistics at University of Connecticut. I primarily work on semantics, pragmatics, and their interactions with prosody.

### Projects

#### Speech acts, clause types, and discourse particles in Mandarin

In this project, I am working on exploring (non-)canonical speech acts in Mandarin, and how discourse particles may affect the conventional effects of all types of clause types.

-- On *-ne*: This project investigates the behaviours of the particle *-ne* in the sentence-final position along with its interactions with different clause types in Mandarin. I propose that *-ne* signals that the speaker believes that the current discourse move she makes is not *optimal* for the addressee: the speaker chooses to use *-ne* when the discourse agents have conflicting beliefs, or the speaker wants to redirect/reset the conversational goals.

<span style="color:Brown">Output</span>: **Updating unexpected moves**. SuB 27.

-- On *-ba*: *-ba* can be attached to all kinds of clause types in Mandarin: declaratives, interrogatives, and imperatives. I am looking at the behaviors of *-ba*, how it interacts with its prejacent, and its interactions with intonation.

**Extracting commitment: the case of Mandarin rising *ba*-declaratives**. SuB 25.

#### Additivity and Concessivity

Additive particles in conditionals can be used to express concessive meaning cross-linguistically (i.e. Even ifâ€¦). In this project, we are interested in the connection between additive meaning and concessive meaning in/outside conditionals. We also look at the other functions of additive particles especially in Japanese and Mandarin.

#### Mandarin post-focal compression and right dislocation

In this ongoing project, I am interested in the post-focal prosodic patterns in Mandarin. I am also interested in the syntax-prosody mapping in Mandarin right dislocation. Please email me for recent progress.

#### Speech verb *shuo*

*shuo* is a saying verb in Mandarin. It can function as a plain complementizer in embedded clauses, or behave as a reportative evidential in matrix clauses. I am particularly interested in how *shuo* behaves in matrix clauses, as well as its interaction with emotive predicates.
