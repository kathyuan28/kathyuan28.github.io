# [Lightweight MapReduce Framework](p/mapreduce)

![mapreduce overview](../assets/images/mr1.png)

We implemented a **cross-platform** MapReduce framework written in C++, and integrated several built-in **machine learning** algorithms (e.g. naive bayes, logistic regression etc.) on top of it.

# [Single Cell Classification](p/singlecell)

![single cell classification overview](../assets/images/sc_intro.png)

We designed an algorithm combining PCA, SVM and ensemble method to predict cell type out of its scRNA-seq gene expression profile with an accuracy of 53.5%.
