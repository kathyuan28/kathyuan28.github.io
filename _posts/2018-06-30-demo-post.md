### About Me

I am a PhD student in linguistics at University of Connecticut. I primarily work on semantics, pragmatics, and their interactions with prosody.

### Current Projects

### Mandarin discourse particle "-ba"

“-ba” can be attached to all kinds of clause types in Mandarin: declaratives, interrogatives, and imperatives. I am looking at the behaviors of “-ba”, how it interacts with its prejacent, and its interactions with intonation.

### Mandarin reportative evidential "shuo"

“shuo” is a saying verb in Mandarin. It can appear either sentence-initially or sentence-finally. I argue that shuo is a reportative evidential. I am particularly interested in its difference meaning when it appears in difference positions, and its behaviors when it co-occurs with other inferential modals and evidentials in Mandarin.
